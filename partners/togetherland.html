      <h3>Mental Health Specialism</h3>
    
      <p>
      All of Bret’s work is inspired by his own mental health experiences. Following a vibrant, healthy childhood and adolescence, Bret’s own sudden and personal encounter with a diagnosis of bipolar disease at age 19 prompted his own deep explorations into the origins of mental illness, and the natural forces that enable people to transcend it. Bret has spent over twenty years in deep research, experiments, objective study and personal inquiry. He has traveled the world and connected with people from all walks of life in order to investigate the origins of mental illness and the possibilities for mental wellness. Bret’s discoveries find expression in his approach to co-creation, as well as dedicated mental health work. Over the last 5 years, Bret contributed to the best selling book Unbreakable Spirit (his contribution entitled ‘Hero’s Journey in Transforming Perceived Mental Illness Into A Blessing’) and has spoken at private events and gatherings, publicly with NAMI (National Alliance on Mental Illness) and done radio interviews. He has contributed articles and social media online, including a biography piece on the International Bipolar Foundation.
